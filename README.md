Logic looper
# Welcome to project

## Project info
Logic Looper is a production-grade, retention-driven web application designed to maximize daily user engagement through structured streak mechanics, deterministic puzzle generation, and a client-first engineering model. The system is architected to deliver 365 unique daily puzzles per year while minimizing backend dependency and optimizing operational efficiency.
The core innovation lies in executing the majority of business logic directly in the browser. Puzzle generation, validation, scoring, streak tracking, and heatmap rendering occur client-side. The backend acts strictly as a secure synchronization and identity layer. This architectural decision significantly reduces server load, increases scalability, and enables full offline functionality. Logic Looper represents a scalable, cloud-native engagement platform engineered with professional UI/UX standards and enterprise-level reliability.
